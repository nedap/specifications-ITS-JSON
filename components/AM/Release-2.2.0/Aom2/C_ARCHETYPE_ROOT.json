    "description": "A specialisation of `C_COMPLEX_OBJECT` whose node_id attribute is an archetype identifier rather than the normal internal node code (i.e. id-code).\n\nUsed in two situations. The first is to represent an 'external reference' to an archetype from within another archetype or template. This supports re-use. The second use is within a template, where it is used as a slot-filler. \n\nFor a new external reference, the `_node_id_` is set in the normal way, i.e. with a new code at the specialisation level of the archetype.\n\nFor a slot-filler or a redefined external reference, the `_node_id_` is set to a specialised version of the `_node_id_` of the node being specialised, allowing matching to occur during flattening.\n\nIn all uses within source archetypes and templates, the `_children_` attribute is `Void`.\n\nIn an operational template, the `_node_id_` is converted to the `_archetype_ref_`, and the structure contains the result of flattening any template overlay structure and the underlying flat archetype.\n",
