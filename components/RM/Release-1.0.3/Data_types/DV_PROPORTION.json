    "description": "Models a ratio of values, i.e. where the numerator and denominator are both pure numbers. The valid_proportion_kind property of the PROPORTION_KIND class is\nused to control the type attribute to be one of a defined set.\n\nUsed for recording titers (e.g. 1:128), concentration ratios, e.g. Na:K (unitary denominator), albumin:creatinine ratio, and percentages, e.g. red cell distirbution width (RDW). \n \nMisuse: Should not be used to represent things like blood pressure which are often written using a  '/' character, giving the misleading impression that the item is a ratio, when in fact it is a structured value. Similarly, visual acuity, often written as (e.g.) \u201c6/24\u201d in clinical notes is not a ratio but an ordinal (which includes non-numeric symbols like CF = count fingers etc). Should not be used for formulations. ",
