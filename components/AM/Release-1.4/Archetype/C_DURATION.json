    "description": "ISO 8601-compatible constraint on instances of Duration. In ISO 8601 terms, constraints might are of the form \u201cPWD\u201d (weeks and/or days), \u201cPDTHMS\u201d (days, hours, minutes, seconds) and so on.\n\nBoth range and the constraint pattern can be set at the same time, corresponding to the ADL constraint `\"PWD/|P0W..P50W|\"`.\n\nAs for all of openEHR, two ISO 8601 exceptions are allowed: \n\n* the \u2018W\u2019 (week) designator can be mixed in - the allowed patterns are: `P[Y|y][M|m][D|d][T[H|h][M|m][S|s]]` and `P[W|w]`;\n* the values used in an interval constraint may be negated, i.e. a leading minus (`'-'`) sign may be used.\n",
