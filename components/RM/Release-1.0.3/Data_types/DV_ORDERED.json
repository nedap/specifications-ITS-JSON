    "description": "Abstract class defining the concept of ordered values, which includes ordinals as well as true quantities. It defines the functions  <' and is_strictly_comparable_to, the latter of which must evaluate to True for instances being compared with the  <' function, or used as limits in the DV_INTERVAL<T> class. \n\nData value types which are to be used as limits in the DV_INTERVAL<T> class must inherit from this class, and implement the function is_strictly_comparable_to to ensure that instances compare meaningfully. For example, instances of DV_QUANTITY can only be compared if they measure the same kind of physical quantity. \n",
