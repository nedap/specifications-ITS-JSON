    "description": "Represents a period of time with respect to a notional point in time, which is not specified. A sign may be used to indicate the duration is  backwards  in time rather than forwards. \n\nNOTE: two deviations from ISO 8601 are supported, the first, to allow a negative sign, and the second allowing the 'W' designator to be mixed with other designators. See time types section in the Foundation Types model. \n\nUsed for recording the duration of something in the real world, particularly when there is a need a) to represent the duration in customary format, i.e. days, hours, minutes etc, and b) if it will be used in computational operations with date/time quantities, i.e. additions, subtractions etc. \n\nMisuse: Durations cannot be used to represent points in time, or intervals of time.
