Note that since this object refers to another node, there are two objects with available occurrences values. The local occurrences value on a COJMPLEX_OBJECT_PROXY should always be used; when setting this from a seri- alised form, if no occurrences is mentioned, the target occurrences should be used (not the standard default of {1..1}); otherwise the locally specified occurrences should be used as normal. When serialising out, if the occurrences is the same as that of the target, it can be left out. ",
