== Additional JSON-Schema keywords

Schema format is based on https://json-schema.org/specification.html[draft-07 of JSON-Schema specifications].

A few other keywords are used to support openEHR metadata: 
`$abstract`, `$inherits`, `$children`, `$functions`, `$invariants`, `$version` and `$component`.
These keywords don't have to be supported by JSON-Schema validators, their purpose is only informational.
