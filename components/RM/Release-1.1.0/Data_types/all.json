Examples of sets of ordinal values: \n\n*   -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3  -- reflex response values \n*    0, 1, 2                  -- Apgar values \n\nThis class is used for recording any clinical datum which is customarily recorded using symbolic values. Example: the results on a urinalysis strip, e.g. `{neg, trace, +, ++, +++}` are used for leucocytes, protein, nitrites etc; for non-haemolysed blood `{neg, trace, moderate}`; for haemolysed blood `{small, moderate, large}`.\n\nFor scores or scales that include Real numbers (or might in the future, i.e. not fixed for all time, such as Apgar), use `DV_SCALE`. `DV_SCALE` may also be used in future for representing purely Integer-based scales, however, the `DV_ORDINAL` type should continue to be supported in software implementations in order to accommodate existing data that are instances of this type.",
